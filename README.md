_teensyRestart.exe is a lightweight executable for multiple restart of multiple Teensy 4.0s connected via USB serial ports.
The source code in C ++ is available for free use in the repository.
The algorithm, after having created a list of connected devices on a textual note, calls the free license executable tycmd.exe from koromix to reset each one.

You can find tycmd.exe's instructions on the [official web page](http://koromix.dev/tytools).
